# vitpose-classification
## Introduction

This project aims to classify VITpose images into different classes using machine learning techniques. VITpose images represent human poses captured through computer vision, and the goal is to create a model that can accurately classify these poses into predefined categories.

## Dependencies

To run this project, you will need the following dependencies:

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow (version x.x)
- Numpy (version x.x)
- Scikit-learn (version x.x)

## Getting Started

1. Clone the project repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Harshit0933/vitpose-classification.git

2. Install the required dependencies:
   pip install tensorflow numpy scikit-learn


### Data Preparation

1. Organize your pose data in the following directory structure:

data/
├── class_1/
│   ├── file1.npy
│   ├── file2.npy
│   └── ...
├── class_2/
│   ├── file1.npy
│   ├── file2.npy
│   └── ...
└── ...

2. Update the `data_dir` variable in the script to point to your data directory.

### Usage

1. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python pose_classification.py

2. The script will load and preprocess the data, train the CNN model, and evaluate its performance.

### Model Saving

- The trained model will be saved as "pose_classification_model.h5" in the project directory.

## Model Details

- The CNN architecture can be customized by modifying the model definition in the script.
- You can adjust hyperparameters, such as the number of epochs and batch size, to optimize the model for your dataset.
